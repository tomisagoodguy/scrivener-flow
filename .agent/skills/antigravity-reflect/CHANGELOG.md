## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Plugin installation error** - Removed duplicate hooks declaration from plugin.json (#9)
  - The `hooks/hooks.json` file is auto-loaded by Claude Code; explicitly declaring it in manifest caused "Duplicate hooks file detected" error

### Added
- **Tool Error Extraction** - Scan session files for repeated tool execution errors and convert to CLAUDE.md guidelines (#7)
  - Extracts connection errors, environment issues, module not found errors
  - Filters out Claude Code guardrails and one-off errors
  - Usage: `/reflect --scan-history --include-tool-errors`

- **90 Unit Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage with mocked Claude CLI calls

- `/reflect` command validates queue items with semantic AI before presenting
- Detection uses hybrid approach: regex patterns (fast, real-time) + semantic AI (accurate, during /reflect)
